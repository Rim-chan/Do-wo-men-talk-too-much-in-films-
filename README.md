# Do (wo)men talk too much in films?
## Introduction
Machine Learning nowadays is an attractive approach when it comes to prediction or classification based tasks. In a typical ML workflow, datasets are analyzed to generate insights, and then models are trained to predict/classify these data given a target(s). 


This project is based on a study that looked at film dialogues specifically for Hollywood movies to examine if men dominated movie roles and how certain components of the movies influenced that.


We will predict the lead actor in a Hollywood film, which can be male or female, for this project. The dataset includes various information about the films such as films' year of release, gross, number of actors, and quantity of words. The goal is to examine how well we can predict the lead actor using the provided dataset, and then to investigate how different features (properties in the dataset) are associated and affect our result. As this is a classification problem, a few classification models will be explored and compared. Only one model will be chosen, which in turn will be used to test on new unseen data.
